## Project Outcome
To create the proposal documentation for a mobile app that has the following included:
* Xamarin Form Elements
* Backend API Integration via JSON
* Multimedia and sensor integration
* Use SQLite local storage
The project was required to allow for upload of data to a remote service and download/synchronisation.

This project also required the following elements:
* Multiple Screens
* Menus, Tabbars, or Toolbars using the correct user interface guidelines for all platforms
* Camera control - not essential yet preferable
* Listviews, buttons, and other user interface elements present in Xamarin Forms
* Navigation between screens as expected for a mobile application
* Stored local data
* Remote data upload, edit, and retrieval
The remote data upload was to an Azure Database instance that has since been removed.

This project required that I design & document the interface, code it using C# and Xamarin Forms with a backend of our choice.
